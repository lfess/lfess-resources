# LFESS Collaboration Best Practices

This document outlines some of the key elements of meeting and collaboration guidance
that is highly recommended for LFESS Working Groups to adopt.

## Working Group Structure

## Specification collaboration

### Early-stage collaboration

### Draft specification

### Formalizing a specification

## Meetings

A primary engagement point for Working Groups is through a meeting. These meetings
are most often virtual, which bring together participants globally who share a
common interest around the scope of the working group. Time is valuable, so it is 
important to run meetings efficiently and effectively to enable collaboration and 
ensure the specification produced is of high value.

### Scheduling and Cadence
