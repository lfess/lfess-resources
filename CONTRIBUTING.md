# Contributing to LFESS Working Groups

All of the working groups in LFESS Working Groups are entirely open and transparent, and it is
encouraged for all interested parties to join the meetings and communication channels to
learn more about the work.

To contribute to an LFESS Working Group, it is required for the organization affiliated with
the individual becomes an LFESS Member Organization.

## Membership

LFESS Membership is available at no cost to any organization and does not require an existing 
Linux Foundation membership. There are two tiers of membership:

- Steering Membership
- General Membership

Each tier allows members to participate and contribute to work within the Working Groups. The 
primary distinction is that Steering Membership enables the member to appoint a 
representative to the [LFESS Steering Committee](#lfess-steering-committee). Members 
generally join at the General Membership tier; the 
[LF Energy Governing Board](#lf-energy-governing-board) defines and maintains the Steering 
Membership policy.

To join as an LFESS member, complete the membership application at 
[joinnow.lfess.energy](https://joinnow.lfess.energy).

## Application Process

Membership applications are processed through the LFX EasyCLA tool; you can learn more about
how the process works [here](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/contributors/corporate-contributor#if-your-company-is-not-in-the-list).

As part of the process, the organization will designate one or more CLA Managers, who 
manage the list of authorized contributors for the organization. Learn more about how to
add and remove contributors, as well as set rules for the automatic authorization of 
contributors whose email matches a specific domain or part of a corporate GitHub organization 
[here](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/corporate-cla-managers/approve-and-manage-contributors).

## Contributor Validation

Contributions made through a GitHub pull request are automatically validated to see if the
contributor is covered under a membership agreement.

For those working groups working outside of GitHub or for contributions that come through a 
comment on a GitHub issue or pull request, the maintainer can use the LFX Project Control 
Center tool to review the current list of organizations that have completed the membership 
agreement and details on who is authorized to contribute from their organization. More details 
[here](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/v2-current/project-managers/view-and-manage-cla-group-details#signatures)

## Invited Expert

LFESS does allow individuals with no organization affiliation to complete a non-member 
agreement if they would contribute to a working group. Contributions are subject to the 
approval of the maintainer(s) of the working group. Please contact the 
[LFESS Staff](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/23/create/506)
for more information.
